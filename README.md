ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @ericktafel,

I am committed to pursuing a career in front-end development after beginning my career in business consulting.
After achieving an accounting degree and working as a consultant, I realized how important creativity, problem-solving, and continuous learning is to me.
I have always had a passion for technology and troubleshooting.

Though I am new to the development field, I continue to improve my understanding and knowledge of front-end development.
More specifically, with HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript. I am currently working on building my portfolio to begin my career as a web developer. =)

I am a great communicator, motivated by any opportunity where I can learn new things or engage with people.
If you would like to chat or have any questions, please do not hesitate to reach out ericktafel@gmail.com or visit my LinkedIn, https://www.linkedin.com/in/ericktafel/.
